MUTE is an animated short about a world populated by people born without a mouth. 
When a gory accident leads to the discovery they are able to create their own mouth 
by cutting themselves, this releases an enthusiastic chain reaction among the 
population&hellip;

This 4 minute cgi short has been created by Job, Joris &amp; Marieke, a 
Dutch studio for animation, illustration, character design and music. 
In 2011 Job, Joris &amp; Marieke made the music video &#039;I&#039;ll take you 
along&#039; for Dutch rapper Gers Pardoel which has been viewed over 15 million times. 
The music was made by Happy Camper, and all voices were done by Fresku!

MUTE premiered at the Dutch Film Festival in the Golden Calf competition and was 
screened at the Anim&#039;est festival in Bucarest. More festival news can be 
found on the [MUTE website](http://jobjorisenmarieke.nl/mute).
